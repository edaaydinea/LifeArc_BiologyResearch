# Project 1: Optimization of Fibroblast-to-Sensory Neuron Differentiation Protocol

## 1. Project Overview

This project, undertaken within LifeArc, focuses on developing and optimizing an *in vitro* model system of human sensory neurons. The primary goal is to create a reliable and reproducible platform for testing novel analgesic compounds by directly converting human skin fibroblasts into functional sensory neurons.

## 2. Background

Traditional pain research often relies on animal models or scarce primary human neurons. Direct reprogramming, or transdifferentiation, of easily accessible cells like fibroblasts into specific neuronal types offers a promising alternative. This project utilizes a method based on the ectopic expression of key neurogenic transcription factors (BRN3A and NGN1) delivered via lentiviral vectors, combined with specialized culture conditions, to drive this conversion.

## 3. Current Task: Experimental Design (Task 1)

This initial phase focuses specifically on **designing an experiment to optimize the fibroblast-to-sensory neuron differentiation protocol**. The objectives were:

* Thoroughly analyze the baseline differentiation protocol provided.
* Identify key parameters and reagents suitable for optimization (e.g., viral MOI, duration/concentration of doxycycline induction, composition/timing of media changes, growth factor concentrations).
* Define appropriate experimental conditions, including dose ranges for variables being tested.
* Determine necessary positive and negative controls (e.g., uninfected cells, cells infected with control virus).
* Structure the complete optimization experiment using the provided Excel template.

## 4. Methodology Employed

The core differentiation protocol involves:

* **Lentiviral Transduction:** Using pre-prepared lentiviruses to deliver BRN3A and NGN1 genes under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter (Tet-On system). A control virus (empty vector) is used for comparison.
* **Fibroblast Infection:** Infecting human fibroblasts (cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS) with the lentiviral particles at a target Multiplicity of Infection (MOI).
* **Induction:** Inducing transcription factor expression using doxycycline.
* **Culture & Differentiation:** Sequentially culturing the cells in specialized media (N3 medium, followed by DMEM/F12:Neurobasal mix supplemented with B27, NGF, BDNF, GDNF) to support neuronal differentiation and survival.
* **Optimization Design:** Systematically varying selected parameters across different experimental wells, as documented in the `Experiment design template (1).xlsx`.

## 6. Status & Next Steps

* **Status:** The experimental design phase (Task 1) is complete. The optimization strategy, including variables, ranges, and controls, has been defined.
* **Next Steps:**
  * Execute the designed optimization experiment based on the plan.
  * Collect data from multiple experimental readouts (to be defined in subsequent tasks).
  * Analyze the results to identify the optimal differentiation conditions.
  * Report the findings.
