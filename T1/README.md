# Project 1: Optimization of Fibroblast-to-Sensory Neuron Differentiation Protocol

## 1. Project Overview

This project, undertaken within LifeArc, focuses on developing and optimizing an *in vitro* model system of human sensory neurons. The primary goal is to create a reliable and reproducible platform for testing novel analgesic compounds by directly converting human skin fibroblasts into functional sensory neurons.

## 2. Background

Traditional pain research often relies on animal models or scarce primary human neurons. Direct reprogramming, or transdifferentiation, of easily accessible cells like fibroblasts into specific neuronal types offers a promising alternative. This project utilizes a method based on the ectopic expression of key neurogenic transcription factors (initially planned as BRN3A and NGN1, but Task 2 focused on NGN2 optimization) delivered via lentiviral vectors, combined with specialized culture conditions, to drive this conversion.

## 3. Current Task (Task 1): Experimental Design

This initial phase focused specifically on **designing an experiment to optimize the fibroblast-to-sensory neuron differentiation protocol**. The objectives were:

* Thoroughly analyze the baseline differentiation protocol provided.
* Identify key parameters and reagents suitable for optimization (e.g., viral MOI for neurogenic factors, growth factor concentrations like NT3).
* Define appropriate experimental conditions, including dose ranges for variables being tested.
* Determine necessary positive and negative controls.
* Structure the complete optimization experiment.

## 4. Methodology Employed (Initial Plan)

The core differentiation protocol involves:

* **Lentiviral Transduction:** Using pre-prepared lentiviruses to deliver neurogenic genes (e.g., NGN2) under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter.
* **Fibroblast Infection:** Infecting human fibroblasts with the lentiviral particles.
* **Induction:** Inducing transcription factor expression.
* **Culture & Differentiation:** Sequentially culturing the cells in specialized media and supplements (e.g., NT3) to support neuronal differentiation and survival.
* **Optimization Design:** Systematically varying selected parameters.
