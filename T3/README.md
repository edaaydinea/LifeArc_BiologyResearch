# Project 3: Synthesising Evidence for Functional Nociceptor Generation (Task 3)

## 1. Project Overview

This project integrates the findings from Task 2 (MAP2 optimization) with new experimental data from a colleague (Ela) focusing on specific nociceptor markers (TRPA+) and functionality (Ca2+ response to mustard oil). The goal is to make a more informed decision about the use of NT3 supplement in the differentiation protocol for generating functional nociceptors.

## 2. Background

While Task 2 showed that 10 ng/mL NT3 (with 5 MOI NGN2) increased the overall yield of MAP2+ mature neurons, MAP2 is a general neuronal marker. For pain research, the specific generation of functional nociceptors is crucial. Ela's experiments aimed to:

* Assess the proportion of TRPA+ cells (a nociceptor marker) among MAP2-GFP+ neurons.
* Measure the proportion of MAP2-GFP+ neurons showing a functional Ca2+ response to mustard oil (a nociceptor stimulant).
Both tests were done comparing 0 ng/mL NT3 vs. 10 ng/mL NT3, using the optimal 5 MOI NGN2 dose.

## 3. Current Task (Task 3): Synthesising Evidence and Collaboration

This phase focused on:

* Reviewing and interpreting Ela's TRPA+ expression and Ca2+ imaging data.
* Comparing Ela's findings with the MAP2 expression results from Task 2.
* Performing ballpark calculations to estimate the overall yield of TRPA+ and Ca2+ responsive cells relative to the total initial cell population under both NT3 conditions.
* Formulating a recommendation on the use of NT3 based on the combined evidence.
* Communicating these synthesized findings and recommendations to Ela.

## 4. Methodology Employed (Task 3)

1. **Comparative Analysis:** Ela's data (TRPA% and Ca2+ response % *within* MAP2-GFP+ cells) was compared with Task 2 data (overall MAP2+ yield).
2. **Yield Estimation:** Ballpark calculations were made:
    * `Overall Nociceptor Yield = (Task 2 MAP2+ % of total) * (Ela's Nociceptor-specific % within MAP2-GFP+)`
3. **Decision Making:** The benefits of NT3 (higher total MAP2+ and potentially TRPA+ cells) were weighed against its drawbacks (significantly lower proportion of Ca2+ responsive cells within the MAP2+ population, leading to no net gain in total Ca2+ responsive cells).
4. **Collaboration:** Findings and recommendations were structured for an email response to a colleague.

## 5. Key Findings from Task 3 Integration

* **TRPA+ Expression:**
  * Ela's data showed a slight, but not statistically significant (p=0.107), increase in the proportion of TRPA+ cells among MAP2-GFP+ neurons with 10 ng/mL NT3 (39%) compared to 0 ng/mL NT3 (37%).
  * Combined with Task 2's higher MAP2+ yield with NT3, the estimated *overall yield of TRPA+ cells from the total initial population was higher with NT3* (approx. 4.68% with NT3 vs. 3.15% without NT3).
* **Ca2+ Response (Functionality):**
  * Ela's data showed a statistically significant (p < 2.2e-16) *decrease* in the proportion of Ca2+ responsive cells among MAP2-GFP+ neurons with 10 ng/mL NT3 (22%) compared to 0 ng/mL NT3 (31%).
  * Despite NT3 increasing the total MAP2+ neuron yield (Task 2), the *estimated overall yield of Ca2+ responsive cells from the total initial population was virtually identical* with or without NT3 (approx. 2.64%).
* **Conclusion on NT3 Use:**
  * NT3 increases the total number of MAP2+ neurons and appears to increase the absolute number of TRPA+ expressing cells.
  * However, NT3 significantly reduces the *proportion* of functional (Ca2+ responsive) neurons within the MAP2+ population, resulting in no net gain in the absolute number of functionally responsive cells to mustard oil.
  * This presents a trade-off: NT3 yields more cells expressing a nociceptor marker but does not improve, and may even compromise, the functional quality (in terms of Ca2+ response proportion) of the neuronal population generated.

## 6. Status & Next Steps (Post-Task 3)

* **Status:** Synthesis of MAP2, TRPA+, and Ca2+ response data is complete. A nuanced understanding of NT3's role has been achieved. Provisional recommendations have been formulated and communicated to the collaborator (Ela).
* **Recommendation:** Based on the current data, if the primary goal is to maximize *functionally responsive nociceptors (Ca2+ assay)* as a proportion of differentiated neurons or to maintain a similar absolute number of functional cells without added cost/complexity, **omitting NT3 (0 ng/mL) with 5 MOI NGN2 appears to be a more favorable or equally effective condition.** If maximizing cells expressing the TRPA marker is prioritized, NT3 might be considered, but with the caveat of reduced functional responsiveness in the Ca2+ assay.
* **Next Steps:**
  * Further discussion with the team (including Ela's presentation) to decide on the definitive NT3 strategy.
  * Consideration of additional functional assays or markers to get a more comprehensive understanding of nociceptor "quality" under both NT3 conditions.
  * Investigate the *magnitude or characteristics* of the Ca2+ response, not just the percentage of responding cells.
  * Proceed with the chosen optimized protocol (5 MOI NGN2, and a decision on NT3) for generating nociceptors for compound screening.
